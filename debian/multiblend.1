.SH USAGE

Usage: multiblend [options] [-o OUTPUT] INPUT...

Options:
   -l X                  X > 0: limit number of blending levels to x
                         X < 0: reduce number of blending levels by -x
   -d DEPTH              override automatic output image depth (8 or 16)
  --nocrop               do not crop output
  --bgr                  swap RGB order
  --wideblend            calculate number of levels based on output image size,
                         rather than input image size
  --compression=X        output file compression. For TIFF output, X may be:
                         NONE (default), PACKBITS, or LZW
                         For JPEG output, X is JPEG quality (0-100, default 75)
  --cache                cache input images to disk to minimise memory usage
  --save-seams <file>    Save seams to PNG file for external editing
  --no-output            Don't perform blend (for use with --save-seams)
  --load-seams <file>    Load seams from PNG file
  --bigtiff              BigTIFF output (not well tested)
  --reverse              reverse image priority (last=highest)
  --quiet                suppress output (except warnings)

Pass a single image as input to blend around the left/right boundary.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B MULTIBLEND 
is a multi-level image blender for the seamless blending of panoramic images, 
such as those created with PTAssembler (my personal favourite), Hugin, or PTGui. 
It is a significantly faster drop-in alternative to Enblend, although it lacks
Enblend's advanced features.
