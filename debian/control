Description: multi-level image blender for the seamless blending of panoramic images
 Multiblend is a multi-level image blender for the seamless blending of 
 panoramic images, such as those created with PTAssembler (my personal
 favourite), Hugin, or PTGui. It is a significantly faster drop-in alternative
 to Enblend, although it lacks Enblend's advanced features.
